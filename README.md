## 📖 Story
### 🧩 Theme
In the mystical lands of **Home Coming**, a profound and enchanting story unfolds. A person from a mundane life dominated by screens is suddenly thrust into a world where knowledge and magical power reign supreme.

In this world, society’s pinnacle isn't based on appearances or wealth, but on understanding and intellect. The residents use intelligence and knowledge to advance in life. Magic here is not a brute force but a tool for those who answer questions wisely and insightfully.

Amid this strange world, the solitary protagonist embarks on their journey. Curious but initially lacking knowledge, they must overcome many challenges and hardships to find their way home. Each step and each question posed is both a challenge and an opportunity to learn and grow.

Faced with difficulties and dangers, the protagonist seeks not only the way home but also the value of knowledge and wisdom. This adventure is not just about a child’s journey but a soul’s quest for enlightenment and insight in a magical world of knowledge and magic.
